#### Practocal and design issues with Backpropagation
1. Noisy data 
2. Hyper parameters like learning rate and batch size
3. Choice of activation function
4. Choice of cost function
5. Poor initialization of weights and bias
6. Can get stuck on local minima or saddle points, unable to converge to global minima. Monmentum can be used to overcome(stochastic gradient decent)
7. Complex and time consuming for processing of large data sets.
8. Overfitting
