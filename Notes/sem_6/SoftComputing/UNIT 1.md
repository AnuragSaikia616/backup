**Introduction:** What is Soft Computing. Difference between Hard and Soft computing, Requirement of Soft computing, Major Areas of Soft Computing, Applications of Soft Computing.

# What is soft computing?
**Soft computing** is an umbrella term used to describe types of [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") that produce approximate solutions to unsolvable high-level problems in computer science. Typically, traditional hard-computing algorithms heavily rely on concrete data and [mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Models_and_Methods_in_Applied_Sciences "Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences") to produce solutions to problems. Soft computing was coined in the late 20th century.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_computing#cite_note-1) During this period, revolutionary research in three fields greatly impacted soft computing: 
1. Fuzzy logic
2. Neural Networks
3. Evolutionary computation
#### Fuzzy logic 
Fuzzy logic is a aspect of  computation that handles approximate reasoning. Traditionally, binary logic handles reasoning based of true or false values(0 , 1). Fuzzy logic enabled systems to handle logic involving values between 0 and 1 throught the use of memberships.
#### Neural networks
Neural networks are computational models that mimic the way our human brain works.
Neural networks revolve around perceptrons, which are units of neural networks that work like how neurons in human brains work.
These small units are layered and combined to form a model, which is able to solve problems similar to how humans think and solve.

#### Evolutionary  Computation
Evolutionary computation is a field in soft computing that uses the principles of natural selection and evolution to solve complext problems. 
It consists algorithms that mimic natural selection like genetic algorithm, genetic programming, evolutionary programming. 
These algorithms use selection, cross over and mutation.
Cross over handles data between nodes to disversify the data and handle more outcomes.
Mutation diversifies an entire range of solutions that helps prevent premature conclusion. It helps introdice new optimal solutions for the overall optimization process.
Selection is the technique that chooses which solutions fit the enviroment(problem) to move to the next phase.(suvival of the fittest solutions)

## Characteristics of soft computing

1. **Approximate Reasoning**: Soft computing techniques, such as fuzzy logic and probabilistic reasoning, allow for reasoning with uncertainty and imprecision rather than strict binary logic.

2. **Flexibility**: Soft computing methods can handle incomplete, noisy, and uncertain data effectively, making them suitable for real-world applications where data may not be perfect.

3. **Learning and Adaptation**: Soft computing systems often incorporate learning algorithms that allow them to improve their performance over time based on experience and feedback.

4. **Parallelism and Distributed Computing**: Many soft computing algorithms can be parallelized or distributed across multiple processors, enhancing their scalability and efficiency.

5. **Integration of Multiple Techniques**: Soft computing often integrates multiple techniques, such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary computation, and probabilistic reasoning, to address different aspects of a problem.

6. **Human-Like Reasoning**: Soft computing aims to mimic human-like decision-making processes, where decisions are often made based on incomplete information and vague criteria.

7. **Robustness**: Soft computing techniques are often robust in the face of noisy data and can provide reasonable solutions even when input data is not well-defined or when there are uncertainties in the problem domain.
