### Type 1 error(false positive)(Alpha)
A type I error occurs when the [null hypothesis](https://www.qualitygurus.com/null-and-alternate-hypotheses/ "Null and Alternate Hypothesis") is true but is rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis. This error is also known as a false positive, alpha error or a **producer's risk**. It represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, and the significance level of the test controls it.

For example, if the null hypothesis is that the population mean is equal to 10, and the alternative hypothesis is that the population mean is not equal to 10, a type I error would occur if the test rejects the [null hypothesis](https://www.qualitygurus.com/null-and-alternate-hypotheses/ "Null and Alternate Hypothesis") when the population mean is actually equal to 10.

### Type 2 error (false negative)(Beta)
A type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is false but is not rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis. This error is also known as a false negative, beta error or a **consumer's risk**. It represents the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, and it is related to the power of the test.

For example, if the null hypothesis is that the population mean is equal to 10, and the alternative hypothesis is that the population mean is not equal to 10, a type II error would occur if the test fails to reject the null hypothesis when the population mean is actually not equal to 10.
